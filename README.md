A Bot I wrote to learn python and get into Programming. 
You are able to make "codes" for people to claim the respective roles. 
Right now Onlyfans and Bestfans platforms are featured. 

!!! Do Not take this project to serious !!!
I just made it for fun/ for a friend who runs a Discord server and who benefited from this. 

As far as I am concerned I will develope this bot and improve upon it mostly behind the scenes with all time availability. Also maybe a command to change the language just for fun. And a feature that will take the role from the user after 1 Month


Right now the bot features 8 Commands visible for Admins. And 2 for users.
Following are visible for everyone: 

- /bf_sub: Slashcommand for users to claim their "Bestfans Role" and see the respective Channels.

- /of_sub: Slashcommand for users to claim their "Onlyfans Role" and see the respective Channels. 

Following Commands for Administrators: 

- /c: This command displays all the available codes, to claim either the OF or BF Role. 

- /make_bf: Slashcommand to make a code for the "Bestfans Role". 

- /make_of: Slashcommand to make a code for the "Onlyfans Role". 

- /delete: Slashcommand to delete on specific code that is viable right now. 

- /delall: Deletes all codes viable right now.

- /sync: Sync the commands against the discord API. 


Commands like /make_x or delete, delall, c, sync are only visible to people with Administrator rights and the message the bot sends is also only visible to the person that send the message.
