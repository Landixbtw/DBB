<h1>!!! Do Not take this project to serious !!!</h1> 

This Bot I wrote to learn python and get into Programming. 
You are able to make "codes" for people to claim the respective roles. 
Two plattforms are features and propably none will follow. 


I just made it for fun/ for a friend who runs a Discord server and who benefited from this. 

As far as I am concerned I wont develope this bot any further since basically all that is needed is there.

Right now the bot features 7 Commands visible for Admins. And 2 for users.
Following are visible for everyone: 

- <code>/bf_sub</code>: Slashcommand for users to claim their "Bestfans Role" and see the respective Channels.

- <code>/of_sub</code>: Slashcommand for users to claim their "Onlyfans Role" and see the respective Channels. 

Following Commands for Administrators: 

- <code>/c</code>: This command displays all the available codes, to claim either the OF or BF Role. 

- <code>/make_bf</code>: Slashcommand to make a code for the "Bestfans Role". 

- <code>/make_of</code>: Slashcommand to make a code for the "Onlyfans Role". 

- <code>/delete</code>: Slashcommand to delete on specific code that is viable right now. 

- <code>/delall</code>: Deletes all codes viable right now.


Commands like /make_x or delete, delall, c are only visible to people with Administrator rights and the message the bot sends is also only visible to the person that send the message.
